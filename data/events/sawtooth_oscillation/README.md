# Sawtooth Oscillation

## Description
Sawteeth are periodic relaxations of the plasma core when the central safety factor
falls below one: the m/n = 1/1 internal kink grows, magnetic reconnection
(Kadomtsev) flattens the core temperature and density inside the mixing radius, and
the profile then re-peaks over a few tens of ms - a slow ramp and a fast crash,
hence the name. The inversion radius r_inv (where the crash changes sign from a
drop inside to a rise outside) marks the q = 1 surface; on DIII-D it is typically at
rho ~ 0.3-0.6. Sawtooth crashes can seed NTMs, expel fast ions and trigger ELMs, and
a crash-triggered ELM can hide the inversion in edge channels.

First observed on the ST tokamak with soft-X-ray diodes (von Goeler, Stodiek and
Sauthoff 1974).

Typically found via ECE radiometer channels (the 48-channel array here), soft
X-rays and core Thomson scattering as simultaneous drops in the core channels and
rises in the outer ones; the 1/1 precursor is visible on magnetics at 2-20 kHz.

## Method
`ece_sawtooth` (`labeler.events.heuristics.sawtooth_events`), a port of the
omnimode `mrms.ece` inversion test with the envelope computed ONCE per shot
(1.55 s/shot instead of ~3.5 min): a 1 ms envelope over the 48 ECE channels;
candidate bins where >= 2 channels lose > 2% of their level in one bin, at least
10 ms apart; a candidate is a crash when the step profile across it (2 ms gap,
8 ms span) is a structured inversion - a contiguous block of dropping channels
next to rising ones. Each crash is a point event with `confidence` = the fraction of
finite channels that took part, and `attrs["inversion_channel_lo"]`,
`attrs["inversion_channel_stop"]` bound the dropping block (end-exclusive).
On shot 198658 it finds 45 sawteeth with a median period of 76 ms.

## Provenance
Rule-based; no curated table, so `raw/` is empty. The inventory notes OMFIT's
ECE-based sawtooth tool and Hiro's detector as possible references.
